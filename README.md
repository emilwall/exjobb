How to test your JavaScript
===========================

Previous title: Benefits and Practices for Javascript Testing

This repository contains specification, report and other
material related to my thesis on Javascript testing.

To view the specification or the report, right-click and
select "Save target as" (or similar, depending on which
browser you're using)

Outline
=======

There is an outline (WIP) on google drive:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S7G1PDKbH3Mznw6A2WbCSA6SCWqHZcv97lxZnG4vT70/edit?usp=sharing

This may not be in sync with the LaTeX version of the
report, and is really just intended for overview purposes.
